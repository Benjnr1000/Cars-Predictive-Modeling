# Cars-Predictive-Modeling

This project requires an understanding of what mode of transport employees prefers to commute to their
office. The dataset “Cars-dataset” includes employee information about their mode of transport as well as
their personal and professional details like age, salary, work exp. We need to predict whether or not an
employee will use Car as a mode of transport. Also, which variables are a significant predictor behind this
decision.
The following will be carried out through the assessment.
- Perform an EDA on the data
- Illustrate the insights based on EDA
- What is the most challenging aspect of this problem? What method will you use to deal with this?
- Prepare the data for analysis
- Create multiple models and explore how each model perform using appropriate model performance metrics
  - KNN
  - Naive Bayes (is it applicable here? comment and if it is not applicable, how can you build an NB
model in this case?)
  - Logistic Regression
- Apply both bagging and boosting modeling procedures to create 2 models and compare its accuracy
with the best model of the above step.
- Summarize your findings from the exercise in a concise yet actionable note
